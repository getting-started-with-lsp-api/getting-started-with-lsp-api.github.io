  <h1>Getting Started With LSP API</h1>
  <p>For detailed API documentation, refer to:

  <h2>Basic Commands</h2>
  <h3>Commonly used commands</h3>
  <p>These are the most commonly used commands for the FLL coding:
    <ul>
      <li>move.forward_for</li>
      <li>move.backward_for</li>
      <li>move.forward_to_red_border</li>
      <li>move.forward_to_blue_border</li>
      <li>move.right_motor_left_for</li>
      <li>move.right_motor_right_for</li>
      <li>move.right_motor_left_for</li>
      <li>move.right_motor_right_for</li>
      <li>front_arm.run_for_degrees</li>
      <li>breakpoint</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Refer to the below sections to understand the above commands
  </p>
  <h3>How to move forward/backward for specific cm or inch</h3>
  <p>To move forward/backward 10 cm at a speed of 300:
  <pre><code>
      move.forward_for(10, "cm", 300, 300)
      move.backward_for(10, "cm", 300, 300)
  </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>To move forward/backward 10 inch at a speed of 300:</p>
  <pre><code>
    move.forward_for(10, "in", 300, 300)
    move.backward_for(10, "in", 300, 300)
  </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  move.backward_for is similar to move.forward_for but in the opposite direction.

  <h4>How to move forward/backward to red home border at speed of 300</h4>
  <p>
  To move forward/backward to red border at a speed of 300:
  <pre><code>
     move.forward_to_red_border(300, 300)
     move.backward_to_red_border(300, 300)
  </code></pre>
  </p>
  <h4>How to move forward/backward to blue home border at speed of 300</h4>
  <p>
    To move forward/backward to blue border at a speed of 300:
    <pre><code>
       move.forward_to_blue_border(300, 300)
       move.backward_to_blue_border(300, 300)
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <h4>How to turn to a specific yaw angle</h4>
  <strong>Pre-Steps:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Decide what yaw angle you need to move to. (You need to check hub properties page by clicking the hub icon in the top-left to find this out).</li>
    <li>Decide whether you want to move the left or right wheel/motor.</li>
  </ul>
  
  To turn the right motor in the left direction to achieve a yaw angle of 150, at a speed of 100:
  ```
    move.right_motor_left_for(100, 150)
  ```
  :warning: **Note that you want to use a slow speed(max 100) for turns to have a higher accuracy.**
  
  To turn the right motor in the right direction to achieve a yaw angle of 50, at a speed of 80:
  ```
    move.right_motor_right_for(80, 50)
  ```
  
  To turn the left motor in the left direction to achieve a yaw angle of 150, at a speed of 100:
  ```
    move.left_motor_left_for(100, 150)
  ```
  
  To turn the left motor in the right direction to achieve a yaw angle of 50, at a speed of 80:
  ```
    move.left_motor_right_for(80, 50)
  ```
  
  ### How to's for turning the robot arms
  #### How to turn the front robot arm
  To turn the front robot arm by 140 degrees clockwise at a speed of 100:
  ```
  front_arm.run_for_degrees(140, 100)
  ```
  :warning: **Note that you should use a slow speed(max 100) for better accuracy.**
  
  To turn the front robot arm by 140 degrees counter-clockwise at a speed of 100:
  ```
  front_arm.run_for_degrees(140, -100)
  ```
  Note that since we are using geared motors, clockwise on the motor turns into counter-clockwise movement of the arm.
  
  ### How to's for debugging
  
  #### How to set a breakpoint
  To set a breakpoint activated by the left button:
  ```
  breakpoint(button=button.LEFT)
  ```
  If you add a breakpoint, the robot will pause execution at that point until you press the Left Button. This is very useful for debugging.
  
  #### How to set the hub power button color
  To set the hub power button to the color RED:
  ```
  ```
  This is useful for debugging to figure out which step in the code you are at.
  
  ## Advanced commands
  - print
  
  ### How to's for debugging
  #### How to print a message to the Spike Prime Console
  To print a message "Step 1" to the Spike Prime Console:
  ```
  print("Step 1")
  ```
  This is useful for debugging to figure out which step in the code you are at.
  
  ## How to go to the end of the file without scrolling
  To go to the end of the file without scrolling:
  
  ```
  Press Ctrl + G
  ```
  A message such as this will be displayed:
  ```
  Current Line: 1, Character: 38. Type a line number between 1 and 321 to navigate to.
  ```
  Note the highest line number, 321 in this case and type that.
